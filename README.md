# Bare-Bones Web Application

This is a minimal web application built with React and shadcn components. It provides a starting point for you to build and expand upon.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.
3. Run `npm install` to install the dependencies.
4. Run `npm run dev` to start the development server.
5. Open your browser and visit `http://localhost:5173` to view the application.

## Modifying the Application

### HTML Structure

The main structure of the application is in `src/pages/Index.jsx`. You can modify this file to change the layout and content of the page.

### CSS Styling

This project uses Tailwind CSS for styling. You can add or modify classes directly in the JSX to change the appearance of elements.

For global styles, you can edit `src/index.css`.

### JavaScript Functionality

The main JavaScript logic is also in `src/pages/Index.jsx`. You can add new state variables, event handlers, and other functionality here.

### Adding New Components

To add new components:

1. Create a new file in the `src/components` directory.
2. Write your component code.
3. Import and use the component in `src/pages/Index.jsx` or other components.

### Using shadcn Components

This project includes shadcn components. To use them:

1. Import the component from `@/components/ui`.
2. Use the component in your JSX.

Example:
```jsx
import { Button } from "@/components/ui/button";

// In your component:
<Button onClick={handleClick}>Click me</Button>
```

## Building for Production

To build the application for production:

1. Run `npm run build`.
2. The built files will be in the `dist` directory.

You can then deploy these files to your preferred hosting service.
